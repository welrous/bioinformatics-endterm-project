# Bioinformatics End-Term Project

## Project Title

Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Authors

* Amina Rysbekova
* Diyar Shakhzadayev

## Project Overview

This project applies computational bioinformatics methods to analyze real biological data and answer a biological research question.

We implement multiple computational approaches including:

* Data preprocessing
* Statistical analysis
* Machine learning models
* Visualization

## Biological Question

What genes are differentially expressed in cancer vs normal tissue?

## Data Sources

All data is real biological data from public databases:

* NCBI GEO
* Ensembl
* PDB
  (Replace with your dataset)

## Repository Structure

* `notebooks/` → main analysis notebook
* `src/` → reusable code
* `data/` → instructions to download data
* `results/` → figures & outputs
* `report/` → final PDF report

## How to Run

### 1. Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bioinformatics-project
cd bioinformatics-project
```

### 2. Install environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
